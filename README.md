# Usage

## Create an Event
To get started with creating a Event, on the homepage first login with "Admin" role. Once successfully logged in an additional top navbar item __Admin__ becomes available.
Here is a demo walkthrough of creating a event:

## Preview an Event

Event details can be seen on the `conferenences/c/[eid]` page which includes the _Event poster, Event name, Event date, Event description, Event sessions, Event speakers_. Please refer to the below demo walkthrough.

## Admin Dashboard - Manage Events
On the Admin dashboard all the events created by the user would be listed along with some additional options to do:
- Add Event speakers
- Delete Event speakers
- Delete an Event

Here is a walkthrough demo of Admin dashboard page.

## Role based access
Greenroom page is only accessible by users with a _Speaker_ and _Admin_ role, whereas Mainstage page is accessible by all the _Admin_, _Speaker_, and _Attendee_ role users.
Below is a walkthrough of trying out the role based access on the Greenroom page.

## Greenroom and Mainstage Page
On the Day of Event, Attendees and Speakers interact through the Greenroom and Mainstage page.

Below is a walkthrough which shows how the _Event Admin_ starts a live stream on Greenroom page, and simulataneously the broadcast is shown on the Mainstage page.
Furthermore, the Speakers and Attendees share their messages using the Embedded Chat window.

# Production Deployment

For deploying the RC4Conferences, you will need to create a Fauna SaaS account, please follow the instruction [here](./superprofile/cloud/README.md) for getting the Fauna (Superprofile) ready for real world usage.
And add the following inside `open-event-server/.env.prod.app`, and replace the `EVENT_USER_PASSPHRASE` value to be more secure.
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EVENT_ADMIN_MAIL="website admin email"
```
Once done, run the following commands:
```
sh dockernetwork.sh

sh startdevenv.sh localhost production

sh startNext.sh localhost production
```

_Note: Please replace the "localhost" (127.0.0.1) with your static IP if you are doing environment setup on your VM. For e.g. `173.456.1.19`_
