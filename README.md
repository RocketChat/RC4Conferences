1. To start the development environment first run the following, the script would handle all process and would output error if there are any.
```
sh startdevenv.sh localhost
```
>Note: Please replace the "localhost" with your static IP if you are doing environment setup on your VM.

2. Setup the Embedded Chat by first following the instructions [here](https://github.com/RocketChat/EmbeddedChat#setting-up-authentication) to get the Google Cloud Client ID and the Rocket Chat instance url. After getting both of them paste it in the `app/.env` with the following key name,
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your google client id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_RC_URL="your url of the RC instance"
NEXT_PUBLIC_RC_ROOM_ID="public channel room id"
```

*The `NEXT_PUBLIC_RC_ROOM_ID` defaults to "GENERAL".

**Optional Starts

3. For Greenroom and Mainstage Page to work, there is a need to add some additional environment vars (`app/.env`), which are as followed.
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPINFO_TOKEN="token from ipinfo"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROCKET_CHAT_GREENROOM_RTMP="rtmp url to broadcast the stream"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_STREAM_LINK0="Asia server broadcast link"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_STREAM_LINK1="Any other region server broadcasr link"
``` 
For more detail on how to get ipinfo token and server links, please read [here](./docs/components/serverStreaming/README.md)

**Optional Ends

Once all the environment variables are set run the following script to start the NextJS frontend.
```
sh startNext.sh localhost

sh startNextGp.sh localhost (Only for Gitpod Users)
```
>Note: Please replace the "localhost" with your static IP if you are doing environment setup on your VM.

4. Once the development server is launched create a dummy event by following the link in the top nav to `Admin>Create`.

5. After the event is created, visit the Greenroom page since only one event is there, vist the url `/conferences/greenroom/1` and the subsequent event mainstage on `conferences/mainstage/1`

(Note: In the following PR, the dummy event create would be implemented, please stay tuned.)

Development Info:
1. The Strapi admin portal would be opnened by default while starting the development setup.
2. The NextJS url would be shown in the logs for reference
```
> rc4community@0.3.0 dev
> next dev


> backend@0.1.0 build
> strapi build

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000 <-- your NextJS locahost url

```
3. On visiting the NextJS app localhost url first time, first login using the dummy login button, then do a refresh to load the admin menu.
(Currently, for development purpose we are using defult secret values).

> For production deployments, please change the secret values in `open-event-server/.env.example` and ``open-event-server/.env.dev.app``

### Route Details

The preview components are displayed on the pages starting `/conferences`.

1. On the root `localhost:3000/conferences` page, there is a button **Create Event!** which redirects the users to the Event Create page.

>Fun try: Try refreshing the `/conferences` page. (Hint: Background image)

2. If a user is not signed in, they will be redirected to `/conferences/confAuth` page, which helps to get sign in or sign up.
3. If a user is already signed in, then they will be redirected to `/conferences/create/basic-detail` page. 
4. Currently, only the basic events data are used to publish the event which includes - Event name, Event start Date, Event end Date, Ticket name, Ticket Quantity, and Ticket Type.

> Please Note: Currently, all the ticket types would be free by default.

5. The `Next` button will save the Event as a Draft, and the `Publish` button will directly publish the event.

6. The other sections **Speakers** and **Other Details** will be soon implemented. Please look forward to trying out them.
