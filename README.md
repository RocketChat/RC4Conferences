### Start Strapi CMS
```
cd cms
npm i
INITIALIZE_DATA=true npm run develop
```

The application is written on nextjs and deployable on all nextjs compatible CDN + microservices and scaled deployment platforms. For build and design, start it in a shell:
```
cd app
```
> If you are running the application on a different port (say on `3001`), then please run
```
export NEXT_PUBLIC_PORT=3001
```

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Route Details

The preview components are displayed on the pages starting `/conferences`.

1. On the root `localhost:3000/conferences` page, there is a button **Create Event!** which redirects the users to the Event Create page.

>Fun try: Try refreshing the `/conferences` page. (Hint: Background image)

2. If a user is not signed in, they will be redirected to `/conferences/confAuth` page, which helps to get sign in or sign up.
3. If a user is already signed in, then they will be redirected to `/conferences/create/basic-detail` page. 
4. Currently, only the basic events data are used to publish the event which includes - Event name, Event start Date, Event end Date, Ticket name, Ticket Quantity, and Ticket Type.

> Please Note: Currently, all the ticket types would be free by default.

5. The `Next` button will save the Event as a Draft, and the `Publish` button will directly publish the event.

6. The other sections **Speakers** and **Other Details** will be soon implemented. Please look forward to trying out them.
