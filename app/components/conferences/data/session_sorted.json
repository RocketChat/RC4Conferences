The newsletter author should be able to supply raw content to the AI generator and have perfectly phrased and formatted newsletter generated. The app should allow for the immediate or scheduled publication of the resulting newsletter to either a team, subset of the server's user, or all of the server's users. The app should also allow for emailing those who prefers to receive the newsletter via email. Ideally the app should maintain a list of dynamically changing newsletter subscribers."

This is often achieved by incorporating emojis, punctuation, and additional details to make the text more interesting and engaging. This proposal delves into the implementation details of the Embellisher App for Rocket.Chat. This app will enable users to generate emojified / embellished text messages from plain text messages they enter in the message box using open-source LLMs. Upon generation, the user will be notified with an interactive message that only the sender can see."

This innovative app takes GIF creation beyond simply searching for existing ones. It empowers you to generate entirely new GIFs based on your descriptive prompts! Here's what makes this app truly stand out: - Prompt-based Generation: Simply describe what you want the GIF to show, and the app uses an open-source text-to-GIF model to bring your vision to life! You can even easily integrate your own model for even more customization. - Seamless Workflow: Generated GIFs are readily available for use anywhere within Rocket.Chat. No need to switch applications or upload files \u2013 it's all integrated into your chat flow. - Don't Settle for the First Try: Not quite happy with the generated GIF? Simply regenerate it with a click for a better match to your needs. - Enhanced with NLP: Can't think of a perfect prompt? Use the prompt generation feature which uses LLM as NLP, leading to even better GIF generation results. - Profanity Filter: Maintain a professional environment with the NSFW content filtering feature, ensuring appropriate content creation. - Extensive History Management: This app goes beyond just storing the last ten creations which is standard for most RC Apps. Pagination allows you to view and access a much larger history of generated GIFs. This app, with its level of customization, built-in NLP features, and user-friendly design, becomes a powerful tool for anyone who wants to express themselves visually within their Rocket.Chat chats. It injects a whole new level of creativity and fun into your communication, making it a truly valuable addition to the platform."

The solution will involve a lot of large language models (LLM) experiments for the user prompt. Therefore, this project can act as a semi-research in which the result of LLM experiments can be used to approach similar cases."

This implementation includes modern open source LLMs (Mistral, CodeLlama, WizardCode, Llama2, Phi, and so on) for a simplified configuration. This functionality also allows users to ask for a new variation of the code or augment/fine-tune the system for a more precise code generation. To achieve this, we propose to design a more intuitive and interactive UX to simplify users\u2019 interaction. Finally, we will explore to bridge the generated codes with sharing APIs, allowing them to be shared to external applications and added to GitHub as a pull request. The AI Programmer app will be published on Rocket.Chat Marketplace together with specified documentation."
