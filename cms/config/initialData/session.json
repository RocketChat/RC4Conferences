No need to switch applications or upload files \u2013 it's all integrated into your chat flow. - Don't Settle for the First Try: Not quite happy with the generated GIF? Simply regenerate it with a click for a better match to your needs. - Enhanced with NLP: Can't think of a perfect prompt? Use the prompt generation feature which uses LLM as NLP, leading to even better GIF generation results. - Profanity Filter: Maintain a professional environment with the NSFW content filtering feature, ensuring appropriate content creation. - Extensive History Management: This app goes beyond just storing the last ten creations which is standard for most RC Apps. Pagination allows you to view and access a much larger history of generated GIFs. This app, with its level of customization, built-in NLP features, and user-friendly design, becomes a powerful tool for anyone who wants to express themselves visually within their Rocket.Chat chats. It injects a whole new level of creativity and fun into your communication, making it a truly valuable addition to the platform."

    "Description": "Setting a calendar event is a small, but important process in our day-to-day job. It can take some of your time when you want to set up another meeting if you 1) Already have a tight schedule; 2) Your coworkers are in different time zones; and 3) Have to switch back and forth between the calendar and the messaging app. Hence, this project aims to streamline the process using a scheduling assistant, that can create meetings or set up a reminder using a prompt. The solution will involve a lot of large language models (LLM) experiments for the user prompt. Therefore, this project can act as a semi-research in which the result of LLM experiments can be used to approach similar cases."

This tool uses the existing knowledge base of the code to answer questions about the code structure and logic. It can answer specific questions about the code, create diagrams to explain things clearer, find relevant documentation, and even suggest ways to improve the code. This will help new developers learn the code faster and make the codebase overall better quality, easier to maintain, and more consistent."

    "Description": "This is an AI bot to help you automatically generate code pieces. A Rocket.Chat app that enables the AI programmer functionalities where users can utilize the tool to create a short piece of code in C/C++, Java, Javascript, Typescript or Python based on specification supplied by the user. This implementation includes modern open source LLMs (Mistral, CodeLlama, WizardCode, Llama2, Phi, and so on) for a simplified configuration. This functionality also allows users to ask for a new variation of the code or augment/fine-tune the system for a more precise code generation. To achieve this, we propose to design a more intuitive and interactive UX to simplify users\u2019 interaction. Finally, we will explore to bridge the generated codes with sharing APIs, allowing them to be shared to external applications and added to GitHub as a pull request. The AI Programmer app will be published on Rocket.Chat Marketplace together with specified documentation."
