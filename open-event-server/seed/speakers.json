I worked to expand my skills, then graduated from the School of Management at Texas A&amp;M University, and in 2009 was accepted into the MBA program of the University of Missouri; I got married in 2000 and later became a software consultant, then a sales associate, then a consultant in marketing, and in 2012 became a software engineer for Dell in their own right.After graduating, I got over $700K in my career, and now live in the same apartment as all my MBA students, and my job is to learn how to help prepare for the job the best way possible in each department and in each place. I hope I can teach my students a valuable lesson as well.I''m currently a graduate of the University of Texas, an associate program at the University of Houston. I''m pursuing an MBA in the U of L program at UT Austin, and I''ve been practicing the same kind of work that I did at the U of M.",
