My journey in the tech world has been quite an adventure, starting during my college days with a keen interest in machine learning projects.\n\nAfter graduating in 2023, I started my professional journey as a Software Development Engineer at Jio Platforms Limited. Here, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to dive deep into various technologies and frameworks. Currently, my role involves working with Golang for backend development, Kubernetes for container orchestration Openshift for managing containerised applications, and Next.js.\n\nMy toolkit is quite diverse and includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, SQL, Redux. On the programming side, I\u2019m proficient in C++, JavaScript, Golang, Python, and TypeScript. During my college days, I worked on several projects using the MERN stack and dabbled in Angular for some beginner-level projects.\n\nComing from a non-tech background, I\u2019ve always been driven by curiosity and a passion for learning. I\u2019ve independently navigated the tech domain, and this self-driven exploration has been incredibly rewarding. My foray into open-source software began after college, and it has been an exhilarating experience. Contributing to open-source communities not only allows me to give back but also continuously challenges me to improve and innovate.\n\nAt Jio Platforms Limited, I\u2019ve faced many challenges, but these have only fueled my passion for technology. The exposure to different technologies and frameworks has been both challenging and rewarding. I firmly believe that Rocket.Chat, with its alignment to my tech stack, offers a platform for continuous learning and growth. Being part of such an incredible open-source software community is something I look forward to, as it resonates with my journey and aspirations.\n\nIn my free time, I love exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and contributing to open-source. My passion for tech goes beyond just coding; it\u2019s about creating, innovating, and making a difference in the tech community.",

After completing my DSA and placements, I wanted a fresh challenge and found open source.\n\nMy Rocket.Chat story began with a struggle to set it up on Windows, but I finally got it running on Linux. My first contribution was fixing a bug in the MultiSelect component. My first pull request was rejected, but I didn\u2019t give up. I kept working on issues, fixing bugs, and helping others, which helped me earn a good reputation.\n\nI made friends with other developers and worked on projects like EmbeddedChat and RC apps, such as Apps.Notion. My hard work paid off, and I became a top contributor. When GSoC came around, I eagerly submitted proposals for three Rocket.Chat projects, including Embedded Chat 2024.\n\nAfter a tense wait, I got the acceptance email for Embedded Chat 2024 on May 1st, starting a new and exciting chapter in my open source journey.",
